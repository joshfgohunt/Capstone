- 1.Explore_Salary_Data.ipynb: Used to ETL the final data pertinent to Salary
- 2.Findings.ipynb: Took the findings from phase 1, and paired them together to create final scores and visualizations.
- Clean_data.py: Used to reduce in-notebook bloat of Extraction and cleaning processes
- Transform_Data.py: Used to reduce bloat of in-notebook Transformation and Appending processes
- Visualize_Data.py: Was intended to host all graphs, but due to the amount of tweaking and tinkering needed for the graphs, ended up seeing very light use for visualization
